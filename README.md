# Mobile-Architect-Programming


Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The app that I developed was designed to allow a user to keep track of their upcoming events. It let them enter events along with the dates of the events. It keeps them organized by allowign them to shoot themselves requirments through sms. 
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  There was a login screen and a dashboard that displayed tables of the events and allowed the user to enter more. The user can interact with the events through buttons to add, update, or delete events. The UI design keeps the user's desires in mind by taking the user directly to where they want to go after logging. My designs were successful because I kept them simple and straightforward.
  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
  I started off this project by breaking my code down into smaller steps. Modularizing the problems helped me understand what I needed to do. This technique is one that I apply to every program that I write and I will continue to use it in the future.
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
  By making the program modularized, it allowed me to test each function as I completed it. This allowed me to have a good understanding of each place where I went astray and correct errors as I went.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  An area where I had to innovate was in figuring out how to use the various views for layouts in android studio. It might be simple for programmers who use it often, but I found it quite difficult. I had to spend a good amount of time finding the way to use it that worked for me.
  
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I believe that all of the components of app run well and are therefore sucessful demonstrations of what I have learned in this class.
